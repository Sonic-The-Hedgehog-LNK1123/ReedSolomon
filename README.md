# ReedSolomon
A .NET implementation of the Reed-Solomon algorithm, supporting error, erasure and errata correction.

Uses code from the Reed-Solomon component of the [ZXing.Net project](https://github.com/micjahn/ZXing.Net/tree/master/Source/lib/common/reedsolomon) and code I've ported to C#, from the python code at [Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_codes_for_coders).
